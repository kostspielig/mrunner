Development
-----------

### Depedencies

For a full blown development environment, you need
[Leinigen](http://leiningen.org/), [NPM](http://npmjs.com/) and other
stuff.  On a Debian based distribution, you may run:

```
sudo gem install compass
sudo apt install rlwrap python-watchdog ruby-dev python-yaml
```


If you are going to run a development environment, you may want to do
this first time you checkout too:

```
make prepare
```

### Compile

```
make
```

### Serving

**TL;DR** run this and go to:
[localhost:8746/debug/](http://localhost:8746/debug/)

```
make dev
```

#### Long version

```
make figwheel
```

Now you have a server on
[http://localhost:3449](http://localhost:3449) that autoupdates
whenever you touch a file.  When touching the Sass files, one should
do as well:

```
make watch-sass
```

Alternatively, it is possible to `npm install` and then run a local
server with:

```
make serve
```

This creates a server in [localhost:8746](http://localhost:8746) that
also serves the release version of the application.  The debug version
is available on [localhost:8746/debug/](http://localhost:8746/debug/)

### Deployment

```
make upload
```
